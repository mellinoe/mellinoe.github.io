I'm Eric Mellino, a software engineer living in Redmond, Washington. I make open source game and graphics tech, primarily in C#/.NET. Previously, I worked on the .NET Framework team at Microsoft, building the first versions of .NET Native and .NET Core.

My main project is [Veldrid](https://veldrid.dev/), a portable graphics library for .NET. I've also created a bunch of other open source [projects](/projects/).
